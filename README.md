REST API implementing Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) making use of own [scv-go-tools](https://github.com/sergicanet9/scv-go-tools) package.
<br />
It consists in a set of endpoints for user management that can indistinctly work with either a MongoDB or PostgreSQL instance, using the same endpoints and business logic.

Provides:
- MongoDB and PostgreSQL decoupled implementations of the repository adapter for persistent storage
- Database migrations with Goose for PostgreSQL implementation
- CRUD functionalities for user management
- JWT authentication and claim-based authorization
- Swagger UI documentation
- Unit tests with code coverage
- Integration tests for happy path
- Multi-environment JSON config files
- Dockerized app and Kubernetes Deployment
- CI/CD with Github Actions
- Async process for periodical health checking

## Run it with docker
```
make up
```
It will start 4 containers. Two of them are databases (MongoDB and PostgreSQL) and the other two are instances of the API, each of them already set up to work with one of the databases.
<br />
Both Swagger URLs will be printed when running the command.

### Stop and remove the running containers
```
make down
```

## Debug it with VS Code
Debugging configurations provided in [launch.json](https://github.com/sergicanet9/go-hexagonal-api/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json) for both MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Just select the desired one in the VS CodeÂ´s build-in debugger and run it.
<br />
Then open `http://localhost:{port}/swagger/index.html`, where `{port}` is the value specified in [launch.json](https://github.com/sergicanet9/go-hexagonal-api/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json) for the selected configuration.
<br />
<br />
NOTE: Docker is required and the target's database container needs to be running.

## Run it with command line
```
    go run cmd/main.go --ver={version} --env={environment} --port={port} --db={database} --dsn={dsn}
```
or:
```
go build cmd/main.go
 ./main --ver={version} --env={environment} --port={port} --db={database} --dsn={dsn}
```
Provide the desired values to `{version}`, `{environment}`, `{port}`, `{database}`, `{dsn}`.
<br />
Then open `http://localhost:{port}/swagger/index.html`.
<br />
<br />
NOTE: Docker is required and the target's database container needs to be running.

## Run unit tests
```
make test-unit
```

### Check coverage report
```
make cover
```

## Run integration tests
```
make test-integration
```
 NOTES:
- Docker is required for executing integration tests.

## (Re)Generate Swagger documentation
```
make swagger
```

## Database commands for Postgres
### Create a new migration
```
make goose
```
Write the file name without ".sql" suffix and press enter.
Then edit the newly created file to define the behavior of the migration.

### Connect to the remote database
```
psql -h {host} -U {username} {db_name}
```

### Dump the remote database
```
pg_dump -h {host} -U {username} {db_name} --schema-only > dump.sql
```

### Drop the remote database (Azure Postgres Flexible Server)
```
az login
az postgres flexible-server db delete -g {resource_group} -s {resource_name} --database-name {db_name}
```
